Player Re-Identification 

We created a system to monitor soccer players in a short video. The objective was to ensure that each player has the same ID even though they leave and re-enter the frame.

Here's what we did:

We applied a pre-trained YOLOv11 model to recognize players in each frame of the video.

We assigned a unique ID to each detected player.

If a player disappeared and returned later, we tried to map him again based on his position and appearance.


What We Tried
Color Histogram Matching:

we extracted simple RGB histograms from player regions.

Helped re-identify players when they returned after disappearance.

YOLOv11 fine-tuned model:
This object detection model helped us find players, referees, and the ball.

Problems We Faced
Sometimes the player IDs kept changing when players were close together or overlapped.

Some players were missed when they were in the background or partially occluded.

could not assign a constant id to the players.
